this one was tough for me, not sure completely why.
I did the first part at midnight, but didn't track how long it took.
I did the second part on December 29, and I still feel like I am doing the
solution incredibly stupidly. May need to check the forums to see what kind
of shortcuts I missed. May also need an equation solver of some kind to really
solve this well.
